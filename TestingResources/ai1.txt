Absolutely awful site. It doesn’t recognize PINs, the confirmation process is a mess, and the AI just kicks you out like you did something wrong. It’s happened to me twice already — date errors, then it claims nothing can be done about the booking, even though I called minutes after making it.

Funny how this is the only platform I ever have issues with. Honestly, just use Expedia — or better yet, book directly with the hotel. This place feels like a scam anyway.
