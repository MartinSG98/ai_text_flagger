Absolutely terrible site , doesn't recognise pin o confirmation makes it really complex Wich involves AI rejecting you. Its happened twice too me now error on dates and rekons it cant do anything upto property yet both times I called within minutes of booking . How come its only this site I have trouble with stick with Expedia . Better still book direct. Crooks anyway
